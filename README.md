# IronGate Bank API

IronGate Bank is working on a next-generation API for secure banking transactions.
This project contains API endpoints, configuration files, and test data.

An internal development repository was leaked to the public.  
During an audit, the security team discovered that sensitive credentials may have been accidentally committed in the early stages of the project.  
Your mission is to investigate the repository history and uncover the exposed secret.
